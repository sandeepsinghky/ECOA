							Section 50-13.4 of the North Carolina General Statutes requires
							the Conference of Chief District Judges to prescribe uniform
							statewide presumptive guidelines for determining the child
							support obligations of parents, and to review the guidelines
							periodically (at least once every four years) to determine
							whether their application results in appropriate child support
							orders.<br> <br> These revised guidelines are the
							product of the ongoing review process conducted by the Conference
							of Chief District Judges. The Conference conducted a public
							hearing to provide interested citizens an opportunity to comment
							on the guidelines and also considered written comments from
							agencies, attorneys, judges and members of the public. <br>

						<p align="right">

						</p>

						</P>
						<p align="left">These revised guidelines are effective January
							1, 2015, and apply to child support actions heard on or after
							that date.</p>
						<p align="left">
							North Carolina's child support guidelines apply as a rebuttable
							presumption in all legal proceedings involving the child support
							obligation of a parent (including orders entered in criminal and
							juvenile proceedings, orders entered in UIFSA proceedings, orders
							entered in civil domestic violence proceedings pursuant to G.S.
							Chapter 50B, and voluntary support agreements and consent orders
							approved by the court). The guidelines do not apply to child
							support orders entered against stepparents or other persons or
							agencies who are secondarily liable for child support. If a
							child's parents have executed a valid, unincorporated separation
							agreement that determines a parent's child support obligations
							and an action for child support is subsequently brought against
							the parents, the court must base the parent's child support
							obligation on the amount of support provided under the separation
							agreement rather than the amount of support payable under the
							child support guidelines unless the court determines, by the
							greater weight of the evidence taking into account the child's
							needs and the factors enumerated in the first sentence of G.S.
							50-13.4(c), that the amount of support under the separation
							agreement is unreasonable. <br> <br> The guidelines
							must be used when the court enters a temporary or permanent child
							support order in a non-contested case or a contested hearing. <br>
							<br> The court upon its own motion or upon motion of a party
							may deviate from the guidelines if, after hearing evidence and
							making findings regarding the reasonable needs of the child for
							support and the relative ability of each parent to provide
							support, it finds by the greater weight of the evidence that
							application of the guidelines would not meet, or would exceed,
							the reasonable needs of the child considering the relative
							ability of each parent to provide support, or would otherwise be
							unjust or inappropriate. If the court deviates from the
							guidelines, the court must make written findings (1) stating the
							amount of the supporting parent's presumptive child support
							obligation determined pursuant to these guidelines; (2)
							determining the reasonable needs of the child and the relative
							ability of each parent to provide support; (3) supporting the
							court's conclusion that the presumptive amount of child support
							determined under the guidelines is inadequate or excessive or
							that application of the guidelines is otherwise unjust or
							inappropriate; and (4) stating the basis on which the court
							determined the amount of child support ordered. (One example of a
							reason to deviate may be when one parent pays 100% of the child
							support obligation and 100% of the insurance premium.) <br>
							<br> The guidelines are intended to provide adequate awards
							of child support that are equitable to the child and both of the
							child's parents. When the court does not deviate from the
							guidelines, an order for child support in an amount determined
							pursuant to the guidelines is conclusively presumed to meet the
							reasonable needs of a child considering the relative ability of
							each parent to provide support, and specific findings regarding a
							child's reasonable needs or the relative ability of each parent
							to provide support are therefore not required. Regardless of
							whether the court deviates from the guidelines or enters a child
							support order pursuant to the guidelines, the court should
							consider incorporating in, or attaching to, its order, or
							including in the case file, the child support worksheet it uses
							to determine the supporting parent's presumptive child support
							obligation under the guidelines. </font><br>

								involving a parent's obligation to support his or her child for
								a period before a child support action was filed (i.e., cases
								involving claims for &quot;retroactive child support&quot; or
								&quot;prior maintenance&quot; ). a court may determine the
								amount of parent's obligation (a) by determining the amount of
								support that would have been required had the guidelines been
								applied at the beginning of the time period for which support is
								being sought, or (b) based on the parent's fair share of actual
								expenditures for the child's care. However, if a child's parents
								have executed a valid, unincorporated separation agreement that
								determined a parent's child support obligation for the period of
								time before the child support action was filed, the court shall

							<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
								Guidelines include a self-support reserve that ensures that
								obligors have sufficient income to maintain a minimum standard
								of living based on the 2014 federal poverty level for one person

								less than $1097.00, the Guidelines require, absent a deviation,

								maintain the self-support reserve for the obligor. </font>

						<p align="left">

							If the obligor's adjusted gross income falls within the shaded

							cases, childcare and health insurance premiums should not be used
							to calculate the child support obligation. However, payment of
							these costs or other extraordinary expenses by either parent may
							be a basis for deviation. This approach prevents disproportionate
							increases in the child support obligation with moderate increases
							in income and protects the integrity of the self-support reserve.
							In all other cases, the basic child support obligation is
							computed using the combined adjusted gross incomes of both

							North Carolina's child support guidelines are based on the
							&quot;income shares&quot; model, which was developed under the
							Child Support Guidelines Project funded by the U.S. Office of
							Child Support Enforcement and administered by the National Center
							for State Courts. The income shares model is based on the concept
							that child support is a shared parental obligation and that a
							child should receive the same proportion of parental income he or
							she would have received if the child's parents lived together.
							The schedule of basic child support obligations is based
							primarily on an analysis by the Center for Policy Research of
							economic research regarding family expenditures for children.<br>
							<br> The child support schedule that is a part of the
							guidelines is based on economic data which represent adjusted
							estimates of average total household spending for children
							between birth and age 18, excluding child care, health insurance,
							and health care costs in excess of $250 per year. Expenses
							incurred in the exercise of visitation are not factored into the
							schedule.<br> <br> The schedule assumes that the parent
							who receives child support claims the tax exemptions for the
							child.

						<p>
						<p align="right">
							<font color="#0000FF"><a href="#Top">Top</font></a>
						</p>

						<p align="left">
							The Schedule of Basic Child Support Obligations is based upon net
							income converted to gross annual income by incorporating the
							federal tax rates, North Carolina tax rates and FICA. Gross
							income is income before deductions for federal or state income
							taxes, Social Security or Medicare taxes, health insurance
							premiums, retirement contributions, or other amounts withheld
							from income.<br> <br> <b>(1) Gross Income.</b>
							&quot;Income&quot; means a parent's actual gross income from any
							source, including but not limited to income from employment or
							self-employment (salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses,
							dividends, severance pay, etc.), ownership or operation of a
							business, partnership, or corporation, rental of property,
							retirement or pensions, interest, trusts, annuities, capital
							gains, social security benefits, workers compensation benefits,
							unemployment insurance benefits, disability pay and insurance
							benefits, gifts, prizes and alimony or maintenance received from
							persons other than the parties to the instant action. When income
							is received on an irregular, non-recurring, or one-time basis,
							the court may average or prorate the income over a specified
							period of time or require an obligor to pay as child support a
							percentage of his or her non-recurring income that is equivalent
							to the percentage of his or her recurring income paid for child
							support.<br> <br> Specifically excluded from income are
							adoption assistance benefits and benefits received from
							means-tested public assistance programs, including but not
							limited to Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF),
							Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Electronic Food and Nutrition
							Benefits and General Assistance. Also specifically excluded from
							income are 1) child support payments received on behalf of a
							child other than the child for whom support is being sought in
							the present action, 2) employer contributions toward future
							Social Security and Medicare payments for an employee and 3)
							amounts that are paid by a parent's employer directly to a third
							party or entity for health, disability or life insurance or
							retirement benefits and are not withheld or deducted from the
							parent's wages, salary or pay.<br> <br> Veterans
							Administration benefits and Social security benefits received for
							the benefit of a child as a result of the disability or
							retirement of either parent are included as income attributed to
							the parent on whose earnings record the benefits are paid, but
							are deductible from that parent's child support obligation. If
							the Social Security or Veterans Administration benefits received
							by the child are based on the disability or retirement of the
							obligor and exceed the obligor?s child support obligation, no
							order for prospective child support should be entered, unless the
							court decides to deviate.<br> <br> Except as otherwise
							provided, income does not include the income of a person who is
							not a parent of a child for whom support is being determined
							regardless of whether that person is married to or lives with the
							child's parent or has physical custody of the child.<br> <br>
							<b>(2) Income from self-employment or operation of a
								business.</b> Gross income from self-employment, rent, royalties,
							proprietorship of a business, or joint ownership of a partnership
							or closely held corporation, is defined as gross receipts minus
							ordinary and necessary expenses required for self-employment or
							business operation. Ordinary and necessary business expenses do
							not include amounts allowable by the Internal Revenue Service for
							the accelerated component of depreciation expenses, investment
							tax credits, or any other business expenses determined by the
							court to be inappropriate for determining gross income. In
							general, income and expenses from self-employment or operation of
							a business should be carefully reviewed to determine an
							appropriate level of gross income available to the parent to
							satisfy a child support obligation. In most cases, this amount
							will differ from a determination of business income for tax
							purposes.<br> <br> Expense reimbursements or in-kind
							payments (for example, use of a company car, free housing, or
							reimbursed meals) received by a parent in the course of
							employment, self-employment, or operation of a business are
							counted as income if they are significant and reduce personal
							living expenses.<br> <br> <b>(3) Potential or
								Imputed Income.</b> If the court finds that the parent's voluntary
							unemployment or underemployment is the result of the parent's bad
							faith or deliberate suppression of income to avoid or minimize
							his or her child support obligation, child support may be
							calculated based on the parent's potential, rather than actual,
							income. Potential income may not be imputed to a parent who is
							physically or mentally incapacitated or is the primary custodian
							for a child who is under the age of three years and for whom
							child support is being determined.<br> <br> The amount
							of potential income imputed to a parent must be based on the
							parent's employment potential and probable earnings level based
							on the parent's recent work history, occupational qualifications
							and prevailing job opportunities and earning levels in the
							community. If the parent has no recent work history or vocational
							training, potential income should not be less than the minimum
							hourly wage for a 40-hour work week.<br> <br> <b>(4)
								Income Verification.</b> Child support calculations under the
							guidelines are based on the parents' current incomes at the time
							the order is entered. Income statements of the parents should be
							verified through documentation of both current and past income.
							Suitable documentation of current earnings (at least one full
							month) includes pay stubs, employer statements, or business
							receipts and expenses, if self-employed. Documentation of current
							income must be supplemented with copies of the most recent tax
							return to provide verification of earnings over a longer period.
							Sanctions may be imposed for failure to comply with this
							provision on the motion of a party or by the court on its own
							motion.<br>

							Current child support payments actually made by a parent under
							any existing court order, separation agreement or voluntary
							support arrangement are deducted from the parent's gross income,
							regardless of whether the child or children for whom support is
							being paid was/were born before or after the child or children
							for whom support is being determined. Payments on arrearages are
							not deducted. The court may consider a voluntary support
							arrangement as an existing child support obligation when the
							supporting parent has consistently paid child support for a
							reasonable and extended period of time. <b>The fact that a
								parent pays child support for two or more families under two or
								more child support orders, separation agreements, or voluntary
								support arrangements may be considered as a factor warranting
								deviation from the child support guidelines.</b> When establishing,
							reviewing, or modifying a child support order, the court shall
							consider during the same session of court if possible, all other
							requests to establish, review, or modify any other support order
							involving the same non-custodial parent.<br> <br> Any
							payment of alimony made by a parent to any person is not deducted
							from gross income but may be considered as a factor to vary from
							the final presumptive child support obligation.<br> <br>
							A parent's financial responsibility (as determined below) for his
							or her natural or adopted children who currently reside with the
							parent (other than children for whom child support is being
							determined in the pending action) is deducted from the parent's
							gross income. Use of this deduction is appropriate when a child
							support order is entered or modified, but may not be the sole
							basis for modifying an existing order.<br> <br> A
							parent's financial responsibility for his or her natural or
							adopted children who currently reside with the parent (other than
							children for whom child support is being determined in the
							pending action) is equal to the basic child support obligation
							for these children based on the parent's income.<i></i><br>

						<p>
							The amount that is, or will be, paid by a parent (or a parent's
							spouse) for health (medical, or medical and dental) insurance for
							the children for whom support is being determined is added to the
							basic child support obligation and prorated between the parents
							based on their respective incomes. Payments that are made by a
							parent's (or stepparent's) employer for health insurance and are
							not deducted from the parent's (or stepparent's) wages are not
							included. When a child for whom support is being determined is
							covered by a family policy, only the health insurance premium
							actually attributable to that child is added. If this amount is
							not available or cannot be verified, the total cost of the
							premium is divided by the total number of persons covered by the
							policy and then multiplied by the number of covered children for
							whom support is being determined.<br> <br> In any case,
							including those where the parent's income falls within the shaded
							area of the child support schedule, the court may order that
							uninsured medical or dental expenses in excess of $250 per year
							or other uninsured health care costs (including reasonable and
							necessary costs related to orthodontia, dental care, asthma
							treatments, physical therapy, treatment of chronic health
							problems, and counseling or psychiatric therapy for diagnosed
							mental disorders) be paid by either parent or both parents in
							such proportion as the court deems appropriate.<br> <br>
							The court must order either parent to obtain and maintain health
							insurance coverage for a child if it is actually and currently
							available to the parent at a reasonable cost. If health insurance
							is not actually and currently available to a parent at a
							reasonable cost at the time the court orders child support, the
							court must enter an order requiring the parent to obtain and

							maintain health insurance for a child if and when the parent has
							access to reasonably-priced health insurance for the child. The
							court may require one or both parties to maintain dental
							insurance. At the time of the adoption of these Child Support
							Guidelines, G.S. 50-13.11(a1) specifies that health insurance is
							considered reasonable in cost if it is employment related or
							other group health insurance, regardless of the service delivery
							mechanism.

							A parent's presumptive child support obligation under the
							guidelines must be determined using one of the attached child
							support worksheets.<br> <br> The child support
							worksheets must include the incomes of both parents, regardless
							of whether one parent is seeking child support from the other
							parent or a third party is seeking child support from one or both
							parents. The child support worksheets may not be used to
							calculate the child support obligation of a stepparent or other
							party who is secondarily liable for child support. Do not include
							the income of an individual who is not the parent of a child for
							whom support is being determined on the worksheets.<br> <br>
							Use Worksheet A when one parent (or a third party) has primary
							physical custody of all of the children for whom support is being
							determined. A parent (or third party) has primary physical
							custody of a child if the child lives with that parent (or
							custodian) for 243 nights or more during the year. Primary
							physical custody is determined without regard to whether a parent
							has primary, shared, or joint legal custody of a child. Do not
							use Worksheet A when (a) a parent has primary custody of one or
							more children and the parents share custody of one or more
							children [instead, use Worksheet B] or (b) when primary custody
							of two or more children is split between the parents [instead,
							use Worksheet C]. In child support cases involving primary
							physical custody, a child support obligation is calculated for
							both parents but the court enters an order requiring the parent
							who does not have primary physical custody of the child to pay
							child support to the parent or other party who has primary
							physical custody of the child.<br> <br> Use Worksheet B
							when (a) the parents share custody of all of the children for
							whom support is being determined, or (b) when one parent has
							primary physical custody of one or more of the children and the
							parents share custody of another child. Parents share custody of
							a child if the child lives with each parent for at least 123
							nights during the year and each parent assumes financial
							responsibility for the child's expenses during the time the child
							lives with that parent. A parent does not have shared custody of
							a child when that parent has visitation rights that allow the
							child to spend less than 123 nights per year with the parent and
							the other parent has primary physical custody of the child.
							Shared custody is determined without regard to whether a parent
							has primary, shared, or joint legal custody of a child. Do not
							apply the self-sufficiency reserve incorporated into the shaded
							area of the schedule when using Worksheet B.<br> <br>
							In cases involving shared custody, the parents' combined basic
							support obligation is increased by 50% (multiplied by 1.5) and is
							allocated between the parents based on their respective incomes
							and the amount of time the children live with the other parent.
							The adjustment based on the amount of time the children live with
							the other parent is calculated for all of the children regardless
							of whether a parent has primary, shared, or split custody of a
							child. After child support obligations are calculated for both
							parents, the parent with the higher child support obligation is
							ordered to pay the difference between his or her presumptive
							child support obligation and the other parent's presumptive child
							support obligation. <br> <br> Use Worksheet C when
							primary physical custody of two or more children is split between
							the parents. Split custody refers to cases in which one parent
							has primary custody of at least one of the children for whom
							support is being determined and the other parent has primary
							custody of the other child or children. Do not use Worksheet C
							when the parents share custody of one or more of the children and
							have primary physical custody or split custody of another child
							instead, use Worksheet B. The parents' combined basic support
							obligation is allocated between the parents based on their
							respective incomes and the number of children living with each
							parent. After child support obligations are calculated for both
							parents, the parent with the higher child support obligation is
							ordered to pay the difference between his or her presumptive
							child support obligation and the other parent's presumptive child
							support obligation. Do not apply the self-sufficiency reserve
							incorporated into the shaded area of the schedule when using
							Worksheet C. <br>
